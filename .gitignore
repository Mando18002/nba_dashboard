# .gitignore for NBA Analytics Project

# This file is currently empty because:
# 1. All credentials are stored in Google Cloud Run environment variables (not in files)
# 2. No sensitive config files exist in this codebase
# 3. No auto-generated files (like __pycache__/) exist yet
# 4. All data processing happens in the cloud (GCS/BigQuery) - no local data files
